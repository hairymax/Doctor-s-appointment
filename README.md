# Doctor-s-appointment

A small service for my city's outpatient clinic to make an appointment with a doctor.

It was implemented by me in 2016

The tools that were used:
- **Backend**:  `Node.js`
- Database: `PostgreSQL` (via `pg` and `pgtools` packages)
- **Frontend**: `jQuery` v1.11.1, `Bootstrap` v3.3.6
